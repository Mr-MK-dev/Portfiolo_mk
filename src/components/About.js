                    Hello! I'm a backend developer and recent Computer Science
                    graduate from Helwan University. I have a genuine love for
                    solving problems, and I'm always on the lookout for
                    solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my academic background, I've honed my
                    problem-solving skills by tackling challenges on platforms
                    like LeetCode, where I've successfully solved various coding
                    problems. This experience has not only deepened my
                    understanding of algorithms but also sharpened my ability to
                    find efficient solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond coding, I worked into the military, where I applied
                    my skills to solve code issues and enhance JavaScript code.
                    During this time, I played a key role in optimizing database
                    functionality, making it more efficient and reliable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my recent freelancing stint over the past three months, I
                    took charge of the backend development using Node.js. Every
                    line of code I wrote was an opportunity to improve,
                    resulting in a Rapid API that not only responds quickly but
                    does so without a hitch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't just see coding as a task; it's a means to overcome
                    challenges and make things work seamlessly. Eager to bring
                    this problem-solving passion and dedication to finding
                    solutions to a dynamic team, I am excited about the prospect
                    of contributing my skills to your company.
